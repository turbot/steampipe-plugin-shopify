# Shopify + Steampipe

[Shopify](https://shopify.com/) is an e-commerce platform that allows businesses to create and manage online stores.

## Documentation

- **[Table definitions & examples â†’](/plugins/turbot/shopify/tables)**

## Get started

### Install

Download and install the latest Shopify plugin:

```bash
steampipe plugin install shopify
```

### Configuration

Installing the latest shopify plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/shopify.spc`) with a single connection named `shopify`:

```hcl
connection "shopify" {
  plugin = "shopify"

  # API access token to request data from the Admin API. e.g., `shpat_ab0a4zaa19c3faketoken924176b387d`.
  # Please see https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/17056443-how-to-generate-a-shopify-api-token for more information.
  # Can also be set with the SHOPIFY_API_TOKEN environment variable.
  # token = "shpat_ab0a4zaa19c3faketoken924176b387d"

  # The shop_name parameter is the shop's myshopify domain, e.g. "theshop.myshopify.com", or simply "theshop".
  # Can also be set with the SHOPIFY_SHOP_NAME environment variable.
  # shop_name = "theshop"
}
```

- `shop_name` - Shopify shop_name refers to the unique name that a merchant chooses for their online store built on the Shopify platform.

- `token` - Shopify api_token is a secure and unique identifier that is used to authenticate and authorize a third-party app or service to access a Shopify store's data and perform actions on behalf of the store owner.

Environment variables are also available as an alternate configuration method:

- `SHOPIFY_SHOP_NAME`
- `SHOPIFY_API_TOKEN`
